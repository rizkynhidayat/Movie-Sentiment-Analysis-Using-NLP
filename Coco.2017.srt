1233
01:06:08,342 --> 01:06:12,845
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...

1234
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:15,446
<i>We'd been performing
on the road for months.</i>

1235
01:06:15,448 --> 01:06:16,750
<i>I got homesick...</i>

1236
01:06:16,752 --> 01:06:18,533
<i>and I packed up my songs.</i>

1237
01:06:19,086 --> 01:06:20,119
You want to give up now

1238
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:22,588
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1239
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:24,621
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1240
01:06:24,624 --> 01:06:26,624
I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.

1241
01:06:26,626 --> 01:06:27,793
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1242
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:30,545
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

(DOOR OPENS)

1244
01:06:33,602 --> 01:06:36,870
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,

1245
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:39,987
then I'm sending you off
with a toast.

1246
01:06:43,544 --> 01:06:44,811
To our friendship.

1247
01:06:44,813 --> 01:06:49,430
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, <i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

1248
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:55,523
HECTOR: <i>You walked me
to the train station.</i>

1249
01:06:55,525 --> 01:06:58,390
<i>But I felt
a pain in my stomach.</i>

1250
01:06:58,392 --> 01:07:00,661
<i>I thought it must have been
something I ate.</i>

1251
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:03,164
Perhaps it was
that <i>chorizo,</i> my friend.

1252
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:05,715
HECTOR:
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

1253
01:07:09,139 --> 01:07:10,987
<i>I woke up dead.</i>

1254
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:14,842
You poisoned me.

1255
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:18,380
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.

1256
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:22,031
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1257
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:27,138
HECTOR: <i>I never thought that
you might have... That you...</i>

He's not well.

1263
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:48,193
I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!

1264
01:07:49,346 --> 01:07:52,681
(PANTING) I apologize.
Where were we?

1265
01:07:52,683 --> 01:07:54,884
You were going to give me

Yes. Uh, <i>si.</i>

(CHUCKLES) It is
very important to me.

1269

I would hate
to have you think...

1270
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:13,903
That you murdered Hector
for his songs?

(LAUGHS)

You don't think that.

What? But I'm your family!

And Hector
was my best friend.

Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.

Oh, Hector!
You were right.

01:09:55,844 --> 01:09:58,446
I should have gone
back to my family.

1294
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:01,016
They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,

but I didn't listen.

1296
01:10:02,853 --> 01:10:05,853
I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

I didn't care if I was

- Who?
- My daughter.

1304
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:35,885
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1305
01:10:35,887 --> 01:10:39,389
I just wanted
to see her again.

1306
01:10:39,391 --> 01:10:42,074
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

1307

I wish I could apologize.

1308

I wish I could tell her that her

That he loved her so much.

Where did you get this?

That's my <i>Mama</i> Coco.

- We're...

HECTOR: I always hoped
I'd see her again.

1317
01:11:48,797 --> 01:11:51,196
That she'd miss me.

1318
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:55,283
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

1319

You know the worst part?

1320
01:11:58,573 --> 01:12:00,840
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1321
01:12:00,842 --> 01:12:04,446
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

1322
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:06,162
Give her the biggest hug.

1323
01:12:08,118 --> 01:12:11,951
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

The moment she's gone
from the living world...

You disappear...
from this one.

Ever again.

I wrote her a song once.

night at the same time.

how far apart we were.
