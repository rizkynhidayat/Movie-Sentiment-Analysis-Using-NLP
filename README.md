# Movie-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLP
This project is to analyze the sentiment of subtitle text (quotes) from the movie "Coco (2017)" using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool TextBlob. Through this analysis, I aim to understand how the audience's emotions evolve throughout the film and create compelling visualizations of the sentiment analysis results.
